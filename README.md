An atomic clock is a clock that measures time by monitoring the resonant frequency of atoms. 
It is based on atoms having different energy levels. Electron states in an atom are associated with different energy levels, and in transitions between such states they interact with a very specific frequency of electromagnetic radiation. The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. 
It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s âˆ’11. 
Atomic clocks are used for various applications such as satellite navigation and maintaining International Atomic Time (TAI).
